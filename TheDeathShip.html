		<div>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Marcus Hansen’s family generously allowed the transcription of his diary to be shared publicly.

What follows is Marcus’s account of the voyage of the 40th reinforcements, beginning with his first entry on July 10, 1918 in Wellington, New Zealand.</div>
		<div>Private Marcus Christian Hansen</div>
		<div>Explore the story through a soldier’s diary</div>
		<div>A SOLDIER’S DIARY

Few other firsthand accounts of the tragedy on the Tahiti have surfaced since its ill-fated voyage in the summer of 1918. In 2012, a soldier’s diary was located and transcribed by his grandson, who had discovered it while going through some of his late father’s possessions. 

The diarist, private Marcus Christian Hansen, was a member of the 40th Reinforcements, the New Zealand military unit onboard the troopship from July 10 through September 10, 1918. He was 31 years old at the time of the voyage.

Hansen’s diary delivers an unprecedented firsthand account of one the most devastating outbreaks of the 1918 pandemic — an outbreak so severe that the Tahiti became known as the “death ship.” 
</div>
		<div>THE DISEASE SPREAD so efficiently around the globe largely with the help of troopships during WWI. Often packed over capacity with soldiers, the conditions onboard a troopship at sea were prime for outbreaks of pandemic influenza.

The worst outbreak experienced by a U.S. troopship happened on the SS Leviathan in early October 1918. By the time the vessel reached its destination, roughly 2,000 of the 11,000 troops and crew (18%), had been infected.

The outbreak on New Zealand transport SS Tahiti, however, saw far worse results. When the Tahiti arrived at Plymouth, U.K., on September 10, 1918,  more than 90% of its 1,217 passengers had been or still were infected. Combined with the 7% death rate, what happened on the Tahiti was likely the worst outbreak to occur onboard a troopship during the 1918 pandemic.

In 1967, a compilation of interviews with New Zealand survivors of the 1918 Spanish Flu were broadcast in a radio documentary titled “The Great Plague.”

Listen at right to a segment of the documentary, between an unidentified interviewer and Lieutenant D.C. Low, who was one of the medical officers onboard the Tahiti at the time of the outbreak almost 50 years prior.</div>

		<div>A sports meeting was held today on deck. We had boat drill today also at 4.30pm and were instructed what to do and what our boat is in case of wreck. 
We had to stand quite still and silent for about 10 minutes and it gave one time to ponder when we were told that 10 men from the left will get in the boat & the rest of our platoon will jump into the sea to be picked up by them. Room for 40 and we are 38.</div>
		<div>Unfortunate news:

After having spent 11 days at sea in cramped conditions, a heavy cloud of disappointment fell over the ship when its passengers heard no leave was to be granted at Albany, apart from a few routine marches.
</div>
		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in.         The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too.
No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O to the Town Hall.</div>
		<div>The band’s outing:

Private Hansen's position in the military band landed him and his fellow musicians the fortune of a few hours' leave. One can imagine the jealousy felt by the rest of the troops felt after hearing of the band's outing in Albany.
</div>

		<div>The SS Tahiti:

Built in Scotland in 1904 as the RMS Port Kingston, the 7.6-ton, two-masted screw steamer was purchased in 1911 by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and rechristened the SS Tahiti.

The vessel then served as a passenger and cargo ship until is was called for service at the outbreak of WWI in 1914. SS Tahiti was then designated HMNZT (His Majesty's New Zealand Troopship) Tahiti and joined a fleet of troopships to transport New Zealand's Expeditionary Forces to and from the Western Front throughout the war.
</div>
		<div>Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.

The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>
		<div>Results from a sports event held aboard the Tahiti are published in The Fag End.

		<div>the O.C that such was not going to be granted owing to so many desertions on previous drafts. All are greatly disappointed and after tea were all sitting about and consoling with each other. A route march round the town will probably eventuate instead.
This afternoon the band played a new selection on the boat deck. As the men were a bit excited on arriving in port the authorities got panic stricken & called a parade to keep order.</div>
		<div> PART I</div>
		<div>Last night was fairly rough. This morning turned out fine and a calm sea.
Had a church service, band supplied the music. Land sighted at last & everyone greatly excited, at about 11am. Albany reached at 3pm. The town from first appearances appears to be about as big as [Masterton]. And the country about looks very bleak although picturesque and in places where broken, looks white like chalk.

We were all in hopes of getting out on leave for a few hours here tomorrow but were informed at tea time by </div>
		<div>Embarked on the ss “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m.         We left the wharf at 1.55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks.</div>
		<div>Entry #2</div>
		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand.
At the P.O I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.</div>
		<div>Albany, Western Australia:

Located on the northern shore of the Princess Royal Harbour, the port town of Albany is both the southernmost and the oldest British colonial settlement in Western Australia.

		<div>Coaling troopships:

The process of coaling was essential to a troopship's speed and endurance during WWI. Refueling was one of the primary reasons for stopping at port.

Coaling was a dirty, backbreaking process, and would take the crew hours to complete. They would sometimes even work through the night in order to deliver the multiple tons of coal require onboard.
Despite being the source of life for HMNZT Tahiti, coaling would be one of the reasons that would lead to the deaths of many aboard the ship in a few weeks.</div>
		<div>The typical journey on a troopship from New Zealand to the Western Front took between six to 10 weeks. Lackluster days accumulated
into long, monotonous weeks.

To help soldiers cope with the
boredom, magazines were
produced and printed either
onboard or at port for 
entertainment, with self-submitted observations, reflections, poetry, jokes and ship gossip. 

These magazines were not published until several weeks into the trip to allow for submissions to be collected and edited. Today the publications provide an invaluable perspective into daily life on a troopship.
</div>
		<div>Troopship magazines
</div>
		<div>The next few days saw much calmer seas. 

Life aboard Tahiti began to fall into routine, with a few challenges along the way. Washing and shaving proved especially difficult due to the constant swells of the ship. 

Anticipation among the troops began to build for their first stop — Albany, Western Australia.

		<div>As rough as ever and cold and waves mountain high. I had often heard the expression about waves being mountains high and can now say I have felt what they are like.

When we struck these waves sideways on we would have our hammocks almost touch the roof & things would fall off the shelves with a crash & the seats would slide across the floor & the boat would shake & shiver and make one think the end is not far off. But we would find we are still afloat by the morning.</div>

At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.

		<div>We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind.

Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables & as no pans were provided, the poor chaps could not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable.
</div>
		<div>This morning we had some physical drill & a lecture on Discipline. The O.C congratulated the Spec Coy on not having any orderly room cases after the visit to Albany.

This afternoon we had a band practice on the gun deck and from now onward we are to practice morning and afternoon which am rather pleased at as the time passes much more agreeably and it is good practice also.

		<div>Entry #22</div>
		<div>Embarked on the ss “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m.         We left the wharf at 1.55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks.</div>
		<div>Crowded conditions:

HMNZT Tahiti carried 1,117 military personnel and 100 support staff on its journey from Wellington, New Zealand to Plymouth, England — nearly double the maximum capacity of the roughly 650 people the ship was originally designed to hold.

While exceeding carrying capacity was not uncommon for similar troopships at the time, the crowded conditions aboard the Tahiti would lead to devastating consequences before it reached its destination.</div>
		<div>A poem discusses the route march around Albany a select number of troops were fortunate enough to participate in.

		<div>One from Mrs. Smith filled with Aulsebrook choice afternoon tea biscuits. Two from Vera H. One filled with  miscellaneous lollies chocolates etc and the other with a whole host of dainty articles, two magazines, one pot of cheddar cheese, one pot of fish paste, 1 box lollies, 1 box pastilles, 2 writing pads & envelopes and 1 tube toothpaste & lollies.
</div>
		<div>The weather and sea was worse than ever & a good many of the boys are all as bad as ever again & some on deck are not able to come below & are lying about anywhere not caring whether they die or not & one or two have been taken in hand & placed in the hospital.

3/- per man today was given out for our canteen fund in canteen tickets and are very useful.

I had three parcels delivered to me today & was pleased & very much surprised with them.

		<div>Entry #6</div>
		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in.         The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too.
No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O to the Town Hall.</div>

		<div>Visit at the Post Office:

Private Hansen had been working as a telegraphic in New Zealand at the Eketahuna Post Office when he was called for service with the 40th Reinforcements. His experience in postal work is what possibly drew him to visit the Albany Post Office.

		<div>After its disappointing stop at Albany, HMNZT Tahiti continues across the Indian Ocean, steadfast towards its final destination. Three more stops remain in the journey. The consequences of one will forever brand the Tahiti as a “death ship.” Continue to Part II to read the selected entries leading up to tragedy.

		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand.
At the P.O I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.</div>
