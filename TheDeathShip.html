		<div>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Marcus Hansen’s family generously allowed the transcription of his diary to be shared publicly.

What follows is Marcus’s account of the voyage of the 40th reinforcements, beginning with his first entry on July 10, 1918 in Wellington, New Zealand.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Amidst the 1918 pandemic, a young soldier’s diary carefully chronicles the ill-fated voyage of New Zealand’s 40th reinforcements and the deadly outbreak aboard HMNZT Tahiti</div>
		<div> PREFACE</div>
		<div>"... IT WAS FORGOTTEN."
In 1967, a compilation of interviews with New Zealand survivors of the 1918 Spanish Flu were broadcast in a radio documentary titled “The Great Plague.”

Listen at right to a segment of the documentary, between an unidentified interviewer and Lieutenant D.C. Low, who was one of the medical officers onboard the Tahiti at the time of the outbreak almost 50 years prior.</div>

		<div>THE DISEASE SPREAD so efficiently around the globe largely with the help of troopships during WWI. Often packed over capacity with soldiers, the conditions onboard a troopship at sea were prime for outbreaks of pandemic influenza.

The worst outbreak experienced by a U.S. troopship happened on the SS Leviathan in early October 1918. By the time the vessel reached its destination, roughly 2,000 of the 11,000 troops and crew (18%), had been infected.

The outbreak on New Zealand transport SS Tahiti, however, saw far worse results. When the Tahiti arrived at Plymouth, U.K., on September 10, 1918,  more than 90% of its 1,217 passengers had been or still were infected. Combined with the 7% death rate, what happened on the Tahiti was likely the worst outbreak to occur onboard a troopship during the 1918 pandemic.

		<div>OVERVIEW</div>
		<div>A SOLDIER’S DIARY

Few other firsthand accounts of the tragedy on the Tahiti have surfaced since its ill-fated voyage in the summer of 1918. In 2012, a soldier’s diary was located and transcribed by his grandson, who had discovered it while going through some of his late father’s possessions. 

The diarist, private Marcus Christian Hansen, was a member of the 40th Reinforcements, the New Zealand military unit onboard the troopship from July 10 through September 10, 1918. He was 31 years old at the time of the voyage.

Hansen’s diary delivers an unprecedented firsthand account of one the most devastating outbreaks of the 1918 pandemic — an outbreak so severe that the Tahiti became known as the “death ship.”

		<div>Last night was fairly rough. This morning turned out fine and a calm sea.

Had a church service, band supplied the music. Land sighted at last & everyone greatly excited, at about 11am. Albany reached at 3pm. The town from first appearances appears to be about as big as [Masterton]. And the country about looks very bleak although picturesque and in places where broken, looks white like chalk.

We were all in hopes of getting out on leave for a few hours here tomorrow but were informed at tea time by 
</div>
		<div>Sunday, 21 July
</div>
		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand.

At the P.O I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.

		<div>This morning we had some physical drill & a lecture on Discipline. The O.C congratulated the Spec Coy on not having any orderly room cases after the visit to Albany.

This afternoon we had a band practice on the gun deck and from now onward we are to practice morning and afternoon which am rather pleased at as the time passes much more agreeably and it is good practice also.
</div>
		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in.         The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too.

No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O to the Town Hall.

</div>
		<div>Last night we left Albany at a little after midnight and we got some more pitching and rolling about and we awoke in the morning with the feeling the same as we felt when arriving back at camp after a weekend holiday. Feeling rather miserable.

A few men were overdue in coming back to the boat for Perth but I believe have been caught. One poor chap was taken ashore here from the ship hospital suffering from pneumonia.

		<div>The first wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic has spread through the U.S. and much of Europe but has yet to reach New Zealand’s shores, where HMNZT Tahiti prepares to depart for Britain. The troopship carries 1,117 troops and 100 support staff. Only a fraction of them will be fit for service by the time they reach their destination. Unaware of what lies ahead, private Marcus Hansen begins to write in his new diary. </div>
		<div>JULY 10, 1918:
</div>
		<div>Entry #14</div>
		<div>Entry #13
</div>
		<div>Wellington
</div>
		<div>A crowded ship</div>
		<div>I often think the skipper & his officers must have very trying time in this rough weather & yet they say it is nothing & that it is only rough when the waves are crashing over the bridge. We have managed a roll call twice a day so far.</div>
		<div>A postcard shows the Tahiti in harbour in Wellington, New Zealand.</div>
		<div>Albany
</div>
		<div>As rough as ever and cold and waves mountain high. I had often heard the expression about waves being mountains high and can now say I have felt what they are like.

When we struck these waves sideways on we would have our hammocks almost touch the roof & things would fall off the shelves with a crash & the seats would slide across the floor & the boat would shake & shiver and make one think the end is not far off. But we would find we are still afloat by the morning.</div>
		<div>Freetown
</div>
		<div>Cape Town
</div>
		<div>Plymouth
</div>
		<div>Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.

The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>
		<div>Embarked on the ss “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m.         We left the wharf at 1.55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks.

		<div>Wednesday, 10 July
</div>
		<div>Entry #2</div>
		<div>One from Mrs. Smith filled with Aulsebrook choice afternoon tea biscuits. Two from Vera H. One filled with  miscellaneous lollies chocolates etc and the other with a whole host of dainty articles, two magazines, one pot of cheddar cheese, one pot of fish paste, 1 box lollies, 1 box pastilles, 2 writing pads & envelopes and 1 tube toothpaste & lollies.
</div>
		<div>Entry #1</div>
		<div>Reveille as usual and weather windy & seas as rough, or rougher than ever. Everyone down in the dumps & some still sick.

Today, we were all given a pad, envelopes and pencil, so this afternoon everyone is busy writing letters. I wrote two & found it extremely difficult to write owing to the pitching & tossing of the ship.

At times the waves would dash right over the bows of the ship & a lot of water would run down in to our den where we are living like rats.
</div>
		<div>The weather and sea was worse than ever & a good many of the boys are all as bad as ever again & some on deck are not able to come below & are lying about anywhere not caring whether they die or not & one or two have been taken in hand & placed in the hospital.

3/- per man today was given out for our canteen fund in canteen tickets and are very useful.

I had three parcels delivered to me today & was pleased & very much surprised with them.
</div>
		<div>Our bunks, when we crawl into them, we look like caterpillars and as mine is right over a right of way to the stairs, the privacy of my bedroom is conspicuous by its absence. Water would run down & trickle in to my bed so got Bill C to move his one peg & so enabled me to move mine to a good position & am now ok.
</div>
		<div>Saturday, 13 July
</div>
		<div>A soldier’s account of his first day at sea onboard the Tahiti was published in HMNZT 107’s official magazine, The Fag End.

</div>
		<div> PART I</div>
		<div>Some chaps had to get down to it and were placed in the hospital upstairs, which is in a very comfortable position.

At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.
</div>
		<div>Sunday, 14 July
</div>
		<div>The next few days saw much calmer seas. 

Life aboard Tahiti began to fall into routine, with a few challenges along the way. Washing and shaving proved especially difficult due to the constant swells of the ship. 

Anticipation among the troops began to build for their first stop — Albany, Western Australia.
</div>
		<div>Pictured above is Marcus’s long-time fiancée, Ethel Vera Halfyard, who gifted him the diary shortly before his departure from Wellington.</div>
		<div>The typical journey on a troopship from New Zealand to the Western Front took between six to 10 weeks. Lackluster days accumulated
into long, monotonous weeks.

To help soldiers cope with the
boredom, magazines were
produced and printed either
onboard or at port for 
entertainment, with self-submitted observations, reflections, poetry, jokes and ship gossip. 

These magazines were not published until several weeks into the trip to allow for submissions to be collected and edited. Today the publications provide an invaluable perspective into daily life on a troopship.
</div>
		<div>We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind.

Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables & as no pans were provided, the poor chaps could not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable.

		<div>Entry #12
</div>
		<div>A sports meeting was held today on deck. We had boat drill today also at 4.30pm and were instructed what to do and what our boat is in case of wreck. 

We had to stand quite still and silent for about 10 minutes and it gave one time to ponder when we were told that 10 men from the left will get in the boat & the rest of our platoon will jump into the sea to be picked up by them. Room for 40 and we are 38.
</div>
		<div>After its disappointing stop at Albany, HMNZT Tahiti continues across the Indian Ocean, steadfast towards its final destination. Three more stops remain in the journey. The consequences of one will forever brand the Tahiti as a “death ship.” Continue to Part II to read the selected entries leading up to tragedy.
</div>
		<div>Entry #4</div>
		<div>the O.C that such was not going to be granted owing to so many desertions on previous drafts. All are greatly disappointed and after tea were all sitting about and consoling with each other. A route march round the town will probably eventuate instead.

This afternoon the band played a new selection on the boat deck. As the men were a bit excited on arriving in port the authorities got panic stricken & called a parade to keep order.
</div>
		<div>Weather fine this morning and sea calm with very slight swell. Quite a treat after the wet and rough sailing we seem to have had so much of.

A whale was sighted about half a mile away today.

Band practice as usual today and we went through a waltz “Il Bacio” which we played at times in Jupp's band and it brought back to mind old times which seem so far away.
