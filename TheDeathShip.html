		<div>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Marcus Hansen’s family generously allowed the transcription of his diary to be shared publicly.

What follows is Marcus’s account of the voyage of the 40th reinforcements, beginning with his first entry on July 10, 1918 in Wellington, New Zealand.</div>

		<div>A SOLDIER’S DIARY

Few other firsthand accounts of the tragedy on the Tahiti have surfaced since its ill-fated voyage in the summer of 1918. In 2012, a soldier’s diary was located and transcribed by his grandson, who had discovered it while going through some of his late father’s possessions. 

The diarist, private Marcus Christian Hansen, was a member of the 40th Reinforcements, the New Zealand military unit onboard the troopship from July 10 through September 10, 1918. He was 31 years old at the time of the voyage.

Hansen’s diary delivers an unprecedented firsthand account of one the most devastating outbreaks of the 1918 pandemic — an outbreak so severe that the Tahiti became known as the “death ship.”

		<div>THE DISEASE SPREAD so efficiently around the globe largely with the help of troopships during WWI. Often packed over capacity with soldiers, the conditions aboard a troopship at sea were prime for outbreaks of pandemic influenza.

The worst outbreak experienced by a U.S. troopship happened on the SS Leviathan in early October 1918. By the time the vessel reached its destination, roughly 2,000 of the 11,000 troops and crew (18%), had been infected.

The outbreak on New Zealand transport SS Tahiti, however, saw far worse results. When the Tahiti arrived at Plymouth, U.K., on September 10, 1918,  more than 90% of its 1,217 passengers had been or still were infected. Combined with the 7% death rate, what happened on the Tahiti was likely the worst outbreak to occur onboard a troopship during the 1918 pandemic.

		<div> PREFACE</div>
		<div>Amidst the 1918 pandemic, a young soldier’s diary carefully chronicles the ill-fated voyage of New Zealand’s 40th reinforcements and the deadly outbreak aboard HMNZT Tahiti</div>
		<div>Interviewer:
"Lieutenant D.C. Low, who was assistant medical officer onboard the New Zealand transport, Tahiti. Tahiti left Wellington on the 10 of July, 1918. Now during that journey, Dr. Low, when you were assistant medical officer, you had an outbreak of influenza, a quite serious one. I wonder if you'd tell me the story?

Dr. Low:
"Yes, well this started just after we left Freetown. In all I should we must have had more than 1,000 cases of influenza on this ship, out of troops in complement probably about 1,500. 

There were questions asked in Parliament about sickness on this ship. Why? Were the medical officers efficient? Were the stores sufficient? Were there sufficient drugs onboard?

But shortly after that the epidemic struck New Zealand and the disaster in this country minimized the other the one and it was forgotten."

		<div>A sports meeting was held today on deck. We had boat drill today also at 4.30pm and were instructed what to do and what our boat is in case of wreck. 
We had to stand quite still and silent for about 10 minutes and it gave one time to ponder when we were told that 10 men from the left will get in the boat & the rest of our platoon will jump into the sea to be picked up by them. Room for 40 and we are 38.</div>
		<div>Unfortunate news:

After having spent 11 days at sea in cramped conditions, a heavy cloud of disappointment fell over the ship when its passengers heard no leave was to be granted at Albany, apart from a few routine marches.
</div>
		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in.         The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too.
No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O to the Town Hall.</div>
		<div>The band’s outing:

Private Hansen's position in the military band landed him and his fellow musicians the fortune of a few hours' leave. One can imagine the jealousy felt by the rest of the troops felt after hearing of the band's outing in Albany.
</div>
		<div>The SS Tahiti:

Built in Scotland in 1904 as the RMS Port Kingston, the 7.6-ton, two-masted screw steamer was purchased in 1911 by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and rechristened the SS Tahiti.

The vessel then served as a passenger and cargo ship until is was called for service at the outbreak of WWI in 1914. SS Tahiti was then designated HMNZT (His Majesty's New Zealand Troopship) Tahiti and joined a fleet of troopships to transport New Zealand's Expeditionary Forces to and from the Western Front throughout the war.
</div>
		<div>Our bunks consist of hammocks strung to the ceiling and we are packed right across the ship long ways & sideways & every inch of space is utilised, for underneath are our mess tables which are also our writing tables etc, & we have to live down here in rough weather.

The food is very good and plenty of it. We have a band aboard & I joined same. Played some tunes before we finally sailed.</div>
		<div>Results from a sports event held aboard the Tahiti are published in The Fag End.

		<div>the O.C that such was not going to be granted owing to so many desertions on previous drafts. All are greatly disappointed and after tea were all sitting about and consoling with each other. A route march round the town will probably eventuate instead.
This afternoon the band played a new selection on the boat deck. As the men were a bit excited on arriving in port the authorities got panic stricken & called a parade to keep order.</div>
		<div>PART I</div>
		<div>Last night was fairly rough. This morning turned out fine and a calm sea.
Had a church service, band supplied the music. Land sighted at last & everyone greatly excited, at about 11am. Albany reached at 3pm. The town from first appearances appears to be about as big as [Masterton]. And the country about looks very bleak although picturesque and in places where broken, looks white like chalk.

We were all in hopes of getting out on leave for a few hours here tomorrow but were informed at tea time by </div>
		<div>Embarked on the ss “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m.         We left the wharf at 1.55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks.</div>
		<div>Entry #2</div>
		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand.
At the P.O I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.</div>
		<div>Albany, Western Australia:

Located on the northern shore of the Princess Royal Harbour, the port town of Albany is both the southernmost and the oldest British colonial settlement in Western Australia.

		<div>Coaling troopships:

The process of coaling was essential to a troopship's speed and endurance during WWI. Refueling was one of the primary reasons for stopping at port.

Coaling was a dirty, backbreaking process, and would take the crew hours to complete. They would sometimes even work through the night in order to deliver the multiple tons of coal require onboard.
Despite being the source of life for HMNZT Tahiti, coaling would be one of the reasons that would lead to the deaths of many aboard the ship in a few weeks.</div>
		<div>The typical journey on a troopship from New Zealand to the Western Front took between six to 10 weeks. Lackluster days accumulated
into long, monotonous weeks.

To help soldiers cope with the
boredom, magazines were
produced and printed either
onboard or at port for 
entertainment, with self-submitted observations, reflections, poetry, jokes and ship gossip. 

These magazines were not published until several weeks into the trip to allow for submissions to be collected and edited. Today the publications provide an invaluable perspective into daily life on a troopship.
</div>
		<div>Troopship magazines
</div>
		<div>The next few days saw much calmer seas. 

Life aboard the Tahiti began to fall into routine, with a few challenges along the way. Washing and shaving proved especially difficult due to the constant swells of the ship. 

Anticipation among the troops began to build for their first stop — Albany, Western Australia.

		<div>I often think the skipper & his officers must have very trying time in this rough weather & yet they say it is nothing & that it is only rough when the waves are crashing over the bridge. We have managed a roll call twice a day so far.</div>

</div>
		<div>As rough as ever and cold and waves mountain high. I had often heard the expression about waves being mountains high and can now say I have felt what they are like.

When we struck these waves sideways on we would have our hammocks almost touch the roof & things would fall off the shelves with a crash & the seats would slide across the floor & the boat would shake & shiver and make one think the end is not far off. But we would find we are still afloat by the morning.</div>

Today, we were all given a pad, envelopes and pencil, so this afternoon everyone is busy writing letters. I wrote two & found it extremely difficult to write owing to the pitching & tossing of the ship.
At times the waves would dash right over the bows of the ship & a lot of water would run down in to our den where we are living like rats.</div>

		<div>The first wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic has spread through the U.S. and much of Europe but has yet to reach New Zealand’s shores, where HMNZT Tahiti prepares to depart for Britain.

At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.

		<div>We awoke up with the bugle call at Reveille and found the weather had changed to a very rough sea & plenty of wind.

Most of the boys [now] were sick and were vomiting anywhere and everywhere, in the eating utensils, on the floor, on the seats and tables & as no pans were provided, the poor chaps could not help themselves but did their best to reach up the stairway to the deck, but in most cases could not get there in time. I was sick myself this day & felt very miserable.
</div>
		<div>This morning we had some physical drill & a lecture on Discipline. The O.C congratulated the Spec Coy on not having any orderly room cases after the visit to Albany.

This afternoon we had a band practice on the gun deck and from now onward we are to practice morning and afternoon which am rather pleased at as the time passes much more agreeably and it is good practice also.

		<div>Last night we left Albany at a little after midnight and we got some more pitching and rolling about and we awoke in the morning with the feeling the same as we felt when arriving back at camp after a weekend holiday. Feeling rather miserable.

A few men were overdue in coming back to the boat for Perth but I believe have been caught. One poor chap was taken ashore here from the ship hospital suffering from pneumonia.

		<div>Some chaps had to get down to it and were placed in the hospital upstairs, which is in a very comfortable position.
At the WN port Dick Hamilton introduced me to Mr. Wicks O.C pantry & gave me & a cobber the option of taking on a job there in our spare time & have the privilege of dining there on saloon fare. Offer accepted but not yet availed of. About 20 of us got a [dunking] on the middle deck with a big wave.</div>
		<div>A sports meeting was held today on deck. We had boat drill today also at 4.30pm and were instructed what to do and what our boat is in case of wreck. 

We had to stand quite still and silent for about 10 minutes and it gave one time to ponder when we were told that 10 men from the left will get in the boat & the rest of our platoon will jump into the sea to be picked up by them. Room for 40 and we are 38.
</div>
		<div>Weather fine this morning and sea calm with very slight swell. Quite a treat after the wet and rough sailing we seem to have had so much of.
A whale was sighted about half a mile away today.
Band practice as usual today and we went through a waltz “Il Bacio” which we played at times in Jupp's band and it brought back to mind old times which seem so far away.</div>

As performed  by Italian opera singer Adelina Pattiin 1906.</div>
		<div>Feeling queasy at sea:

The first few days of the ship brought regular bouts of seasickness among those inexperienced with the rhythmic swells of ship at sea. This would continue to recur for many soldiers upon leaving each port of call on the Tahiti's journey.
</div>
		<div>The front cover of the magazine features an illustration of a man smoking. “NZEF 40” stands for New Zealand Expeditionary Force no. 40, which is the title of the military force aboard the Tahiti.</div>
		<div>Entry #22</div>
		<div>Embarked on the ss “Tahiti” for England with the 40th Specs at about 10 a.m.         We left the wharf at 1.55 p.m. and finally set sail at 5 p.m. Started off in fine weather and all well.

There were 4 companies of infantry, A B C & E, and one coy of artillery and our own coy, the 40th Specs on board in this trip & no doubt the total number will be about 1200, truly a large number to be packed on this vessel, which I hear is about 7000 tons, and where I am domiciled, we are packed in like sardines in the bows of the ship ‘tween decks.</div>
		<div>Crowded conditions:

HMNZT Tahiti carried 1,117 military personnel and 100 support staff on its journey from Wellington, New Zealand to Plymouth, England — nearly double the maximum capacity of the roughly 650 people the ship was originally designed to hold.

While exceeding carrying capacity was not uncommon for similar troopships at the time, the crowded conditions aboard the Tahiti would lead to devastating consequences before it reached its destination.</div>
		<div>A poem discusses the route march around Albany a select number of troops were fortunate enough to participate in.
</div>
		<div>One from Mrs. Smith filled with Aulsebrook choice afternoon tea biscuits. Two from Vera H. One filled with  miscellaneous lollies chocolates etc and the other with a whole host of dainty articles, two magazines, one pot of cheddar cheese, one pot of fish paste, 1 box lollies, 1 box pastilles, 2 writing pads & envelopes and 1 tube toothpaste & lollies.
</div>
		<div>The weather and sea was worse than ever & a good many of the boys are all as bad as ever again & some on deck are not able to come below & are lying about anywhere not caring whether they die or not & one or two have been taken in hand & placed in the hospital.

3/- per man today was given out for our canteen fund in canteen tickets and are very useful.

I had three parcels delivered to me today & was pleased & very much surprised with them.

		<div>We were anchored in the port of Albany and stores and coal were taken in.         The weather was fine and we were all to go ashore for a route march. As we were anchored away from the wharf a launch was chartered to take us ashore. Three trips were required and £15 was the fee charged & at the expense of the men too.
No leave was given but a number were told off to get any articles required by the men. The band went ashore in the first trip and marched up to the town and waited for each company and then played them from the P.O to the Town Hall.</div>

Private Hansen had been working as a telegraphic in New Zealand at the Eketahuna Post Office when he was called for service with the 40th Reinforcements. His experience in postal work is what possibly drew him to visit the Albany Post Office.

		<div>Three times we had to do this and then we were at liberty till 4pm. We all made good use of the restaurants & ham and eggs had a good demand.
At the P.O I became acquainted with an employee who very kindly showed me around the office, was introduced to the PM there who has been in this office since he was 14 and is now 57. Rather a good record. This town is a very nice place & has some very picturesque houses and buildings. The harbour is very big also.</div>
		<div> PART I: A CROWDED SHIP</div>
		<div>Entry #40</div>
		<div>ON 1 AUGUST 1918, while the Tahiti continued its voyage to Plymouth, another troopship, HMS Mantua, departed Plymouth for Freetown, Sierra Leone. The paths of these ships were fated to cross before the end of the month.

Like the Tahiti, the Mantua had been an ocean liner before it was converted into a military cruiser in 1914. And like the Tahiti, the Mantua carried troops bound for the battlefield. However, in August 1918 the Mantua delivered more than just soldiers to Freetown.

Ship logs indicate that an influenza outbreak emerged onboard within two days of departing Plymouth. By the time the Mantua arrived in Freetown on August 15, over 200 of its crew were sick. When local workers boarded the ship to load coal, they brought the disease back with them to shore. And in only ten days, 500 of the 600 coal yard workers were too sick to come into work.
</div>
		<div>This ballad published in The Fag End sings of the hope and pride carried by the young men aboard the ship.

</div>
		<div>The virus behind the second wave of the 1918 pandemic was far more severe than its predecessor. Its victim could be healthy one moment, and dead in a matter of hours. 
For some, death would come more slowly, as their lungs gradually filled with fluid over a period of multiple days until they suffocated. With the hospital filled over capacity just one day after leaving Freetown, it was clear. Death had boarded HMNZT Tahiti.

</div>
		<div>All day fresh water was pumped into the ship from water vessels tugged up to the side. [Locals] were parading about up to the side of the ship and were selling fruit, cocoa-nuts etc & soon were diving for coins thrown in the water.

The ship signalers started again today & have had
to change quarters owing to shifts having to be
worked out.

</div>
		<div>Tomorrow we are to sail again & we are all about tired of being anchored here.

No band today but we played a programme this evening instead. Was told that signals received from the Japanese steamer next to us said that they also enjoyed the music.
</div>
		<div>All roused at 4.30am for parade at 5am with life belts on. We entered Freetown at daybreak, weather hot & muggy & occasionally a shower of rain. The view coming in was very pretty and reminded me very much of NZ. Hills and any amount of trees, palms etc. by the look of them.

No leave granted to anyone today. Parades were washed out but we held our band parades as usual & this afternoon played a few selections on the boat deck. The port here is full of ships cargo, troops, etc, etc, & I hear we are to leave here on Sunday.

		<div>Still in Freetown and all provisions etc now on board, after the first day [locals] were not allowed near the boat with their fruit etc & were kept off with a revolver shot or two from the skipper or an officer.

The weather is very hot & a shower occasionally. The water was also a bit rough.

All the time we have been here there has been about twenty odd ships anchored in the harbour, chiefly cargo vessels and a man-o-war and also the auxiliary war ship for our escort.

		<div>Entry #43</div>
		<div>Read “The Epic of the 40th,” a poem written  shortly after the ship’s previous stop at Albany.

</div>
		<div>The pier is really beautiful and is an ideal place for concerts etc and the view from the town which did at night, was just beautiful. It is a good long walk all around the whole pier and one can get refreshments there also. People were also fishing there.
</div>
		<div>Left Capetown at 8.40am, weather still fine but ship rolling a lot, later on rolling not so bad. All feeling very tired and sleepy as the last two nights we have had about 5 hours sleep. I was on fatigue this morning from 6am till about 10am with a dozen others scrubbing decks after the coaling. 

No band today, everybody too tired and down in the dumps at leaving land again. Our stay at Capetown was very enjoyable and all had a good time there. There are some very nice houses and buildings very much like the same as NZ and the bungalow style of house seems to get a good hearing.

		<div>At 3pm we went thru’ the GPO, took about 2 hours and then had tea, eggs and chips. In the evening went to the Tivoli Vaudeville, wasn’t bad, not as good as Fullers though.
The town and surroundings are very nice. Town about as big as Wanganui. The mountains table lions head etc look very grim on first appearance.         The railway station we also had a look at and is a very nice one very much like an arcade of shops. The wharves are very large also & we were berthed about two miles from town.</div>

		<div>Sunday 11 August
</div>
		<div>The virus swept through the colony. Businesses either closed or remained open with a skeleton crew of essential workers. Travel was restricted and the town’s streets remained relatively empty while hundreds died each week. The devastation was immediate — the deadly second wave of the 1918 Spanish Flu had entered Africa.

While the virus raged in Freetown, the Tahiti remained steadfast in its course to Plymouth. Two more port-of-calls remained in the journey: Cape Town, South Africa, and as fate would have it, Freetown.

Private Marcus Hansen continued to write in his diary. His entries would unfortunately mark the final days of the first New Zealanders to die from the 1918 pandemic.
</div>
		<div>Last night we were steaming very slowly to arrive in Capetown harbour in the daylight which we did about 8am. Leave was given all day till 11.30pm. Troops were marched into town headed by band, arriving there about midday.
Had dinner at Maxims with Callery and Leeming. Good dinner, 5 courses. A lot of the troops patronised this place also. The weather was perfect like midsummer and is really their mid winter. Did some shopping, book of views, ostrich feathers and jackhol skins etc.</div>

		<div>Cape Town, South Africa:

With the discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa in the late 19th century, Cape Town and several other South African cities went through an extended period of industrialization. This period saw the development of railways, influx of European businesses, and racial segregation — which persists to this day.
</div>

		<div>The deadly second wave of the influenza pandemic is in its early stages, aided by troop movements throughout the globe. Three weeks into its voyage, HMNZT Tahiti continues its journey to Plymouth. Two more port of calls remain in the trip. One of them — Freetown, Sierra Leone — will be teeming with the virus by the time the Tahiti arrives. Private Hansen writes in his diary, marking the last days of many aboard the ship.</div>

		<div>I saw the most beautiful sunset tonight that I have ever seen in my life. It was a real picture & I watched it for about an hour. It was really wonderful and seemed to change all the time into different colours etc. & one could see the sun drop into the horizon quite distinctly.

Also lightening tonight after tea. Rumours now that Durban will be our next port of call.

[Locals] were loading coal all night & all day & water is still being pumped aboard. We hope to give a concert on the other ship tomorrow & I hope this will be done, as I would like a visit there.
</div>
		<div>Another beautiful day & calm sea. Had a sudden shower of rain at 11am & lasted about half an hour. Weather very warm now.

This morning I had an hour’s fatigue brass polishing & at 9am the band Sergt spoke to the Sergt Major about it with the result that I was relieved a little after 9am and was then able to attend band parade. We had two band parades as usual today & I suppose will very shortly be playing in Capetown now.

		<div>Still in Freetown, weather warm and all well. No leave allowed here as yellow fever is prevalent on shore.

Fair amount of rain today and this morning we all had a bath in it on the well deck & it was just decent, the best wash for six weeks & we needed it too. No band parades today but we played a programme on the boat deck this evening.

A boat came in this afternoon about tea time with returning NZ soldiers, & there is great excitement on board and signals were exchanged between the boys by flags & semaphore.

		<div>1 AUGUST 1918:
</div>
		<div>It was a grand sight to see us steaming out of the harbour one behind the other and we had the band 
out on the boat deck to celebrate the occasion. 

We are now travelling in two lines of 5 and the war ship in the lead. She shows two lights and the others one as far as I can see.

The hospital is over full and also a dozen patients 
on deck.

		<div>Orders today to parade at 9am with life belts on as we are to make a start again. Weather fine & hot, sea smooth and we have left about 9.30am. All told the convoy consists of 10 ships and the escort auxiliary cruiser which is a [P10] boat two funneller & a very nice looking steamer.

There is one passenger boat, ourselves & the rest are cargo boats, we are only to travel about 10knots an hour. All port holes have been painted black & all have been warned in regard to lights being shown on deck.
</div>

		<div>Only one practice with the band today, too rough this morning and of course could not use the Sergt’s mess room. This afternoon the sea is calmer but after tea it has started to come up rough again. 

Feeling a bit seedy today and still have a slight cold. Throat almost better now.
</div>
		<div>My health is still good with the exception of a couple of blisters on the roof of my mouth but not very bad. A few flying fish can still be seen alongside the ship but all very small ones.

Guard duty on the lookout for submarines etc is to be started tomorrow.

		<div>Monday 26 August
</div>
		<div>Last night and this morning I think is about the roughest wind and sea we have had so far. I woke at about midnight and could not sleep again owing to the noise and swinging about of the hammock.

We expect to be in Capetown in about a week and are all looking forward to seeing land again. It was a great sight to be on deck and to watch the waves washing up over the bows and it was a common thing to see the spray come right over the bridge.
</div>
		<div>At 3pm we went thru’ the GPO, took about 2 hours and then had tea, eggs and chips. In the evening went to the Tivoli Vaudeville, wasn’t bad, not as good as Fullers though.

		<div>Weather still warm and sea smooth. The boat is changing its course every 10 minutes for some reason or other.

Held two band practices as usual and went through
a couple of new pieces (cornet solo). The mail closes 
9.30 tonight; posted two letters and one pc. A mail
will be posted at Freetown if there is a boat leaving there shortly, we expect to sight land shortly now, Thursday perhaps.

		<div> PART II: A STEADFAST SHIP</div>
		<div>Sunday 1 September</div>
		<div>Weather very cloudy and windy, sea very rough and some very big waves at times. We have to travel at very slow rate on account of one convoy not being able to keep up with the rest. 

One burial today. Orders now to wear our life belts continuously. Owing to the disease on board we have been advised to destroy any letters we have written so as not to spread the disease. Heard today that the Sergeant’s mess have received from the skipper a certificate asking them to sign to the effect that the food and general comfort on this ship was all that could be desired and not one would sign it. 

This speaks for itself in face of all the deaths on board from sickness and lack of medicine, and general comfort, why the only place we can sit on deck is the floor and that is often wet.
</div>
		<div>Still fine with a fair breeze, sea bit rough. At 6.30am a man jumped overboard, we pulled up but could not find him. Another batch of burials, total to date 26. 

We are supposed to arrive at Plymouth on Monday 9th. 
I am still mess orderly and won’t be sorry when this journey which is getting very miserable is over. 

Feel fairly well now but want a good meal or two and a clean one. 

We are still in the same position with the other boats.

		<div>Fine, strong breeze most of the day and sea choppy. More burials again, total this morning was 59. Our Coy has lost 5. I suppose at the rate we are going we will lose about 100. 

We had a bit more food to eat today and not before it was due either. We came from a country where they grow meat & we are treated as though we are kids and don’t require any. 

The Canteen will close tomorrow so it looks as though we are nearing a port. We expect to meet a couple more escorts tomorrow. 

Was mess orderly again today. There is an awful lot of coughing going on since this sickness has come among us & all night long there is a continual barking in the [cell].

		<div>Fine day and sea like glass. Quite a gloom was cast round the cabin as soon as we were up when three deaths were reported on board. The burials took place at 11am and there were 4 burials. The Colonel read the service and it was quite a touching scene.

This afternoon two more burials took place and there is another death. The other ships are also busy with burials. One of the deaths is our Clarionette player in the band and a beautiful player he was too. 

The strange thing about this sickness is that the big strong men seem to get it the worst and are the ones that die. One of the deaths is namesake of myself I hear. 

Today was mess orderly again. Was also able to eat a bit today and feel much better.

		<div>WAIKATO, New Zealand — High up on the south side of the entrance to the Waikato River, an old soda bottle was found partly buried in the sand. The glass was weathered nearly smooth and the cork had started to decay, but the contents had managed to withstand the test of time. 

In addition to a small quantity of black sand, the bottle contained a page from a small, loose-leaf notebook and a telegram envelope dated July 10, 1918 — the day the Tahiti departed Wellington 18 years prior. One side of the page contained the following message, as published in the local newspaper:

“July 12, 1918. H.M.N.Z.T. 107. T.S.S. Tahiti, 48 hours out from Wellington, New Zealand, steering due west. Greetings from the 40th Machine-gun Section, N.Z.E.F. Corporal A. W. Brown, 62863, and Private W. F. Brown, 74777. Will be home some day.”

The bottle’s message was a hopeful promise that tragically could not be realized by 78 of those onboard that voyage.

		<div>Fine again with a shower or two and a stiff breeze blowing. Much cooler now and sea a bit choppy this morning. 

More deaths and burials, total now 42. A crying shame but it is only to be expected when human beings are herded together the way they have been on this boat. We have not had a fair deal at all. One of the Officers, one of the crew and one of ship’s engineers are included in today’s list of dead. 

Am mess orderly again today. We are all hungering for the sight of land and are all heartily sick of the sea. Where ever any one goes, the same old topic is spoken, “When we get on shore again”. Oh well a few more days will do it now if we don’t get torpedoed.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>""Drugs of course ran out in two days. And whatever was left we put into a bucket, mixed it up with water, and gave a dose of this mixture to whoever reported sick.

The firemen and crew were affected, so the rule was made after consultation with the Commanding Officer that anybody who had a temperature of 102 and over was allowed to lay on the deck. And anybody with just below 102 had to work, otherwise the ship couldn't go on."

		<div>Hear Dr. D.C. Low talk about some symptoms of the 1918 influenza.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div></div>
		<div>A deadly disease
</div>
		<div>Initially, it was reported that nothing was known of what became of the bottle’s original senders. But soon afterwards, one of them, Corporal A.W. Brown, was located in Christchurch, New Zealand. 

Brown recalled the journey as ill-fated from the start. When marching to board the ship in Wellington, the parade passed a funeral — which was seen as a bad omen by some of the men. The 40th’s misfortune continued when they encountered the terrible storm shortly after departing from Wellington.

The influenza outbreak would ultimately earn HMNZT Tahiti its title as “The Death Ship.” However the tragedy was quickly overshadowed by the widespread devastation caused by the 1918 pandemic. In the words of Dr. D.C. Low, “it was forgotten.”

But today — in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic — and with the aid of a soldier’s diary, a half-century old radio interview, and a message in a bottle the story of the “The Death Ship” and the 40th reinforcements can continue to live on.
</div>
		<div>Hear Dr. D.C. Low speak about how
quickly the medicine ran out aboard.
</div>
		<div>Fine day smooth sea & a slight breeze. Sickness still prevalent and 4 more burials today. One of the Specs, Kemp by name, was one of the unfortunate in today’s lot. 
The position of our ship today is changed, we are on the extreme right and consequently have to do submarine guard duty. 


Feeling just about well now and would relish a decent meal but I dare say it will be a long while before any decent meals are seen again, they won’t be seen in the army I am certain of that.

I am mess orderly again today and dare say will be until I get to England. I don’t think the band will have much more to do on the voyage. Rain appears to be coming up this evening and if so it will not be too good for the invalids on the deck.
</div>
		<div>Not enough medicine
</div>
		<div>Warm and calm again and sea smooth. The cruiser at times leaves us for a look round on her own and then joins up again at night when she usually has a fair amount of signaling to do.

Still more parading sick and about 900 must be down with it now. All decks are covered with sick men and also B company’s quarters were used for a lot of men but only for one night, next day they were all moved upstairs to the boat deck which is covered in all around now with canvas. 

Dysentery and diarrhoea seem to have got a hold of some also. We have had no deaths yet I am glad to say but there has been quite a number of burials on the other boats which has yellow fever on board. About the same myself and have eaten nothing hardly.

		<div>""We had a hospital of twelve beds, three medical officers — one of whom was a British Army medical officer, who being invalidated with yellow fever from Freetown, wasn't much use on the ship.
The senior medical officer promptly got influenza and pneumonia, and he wasn't of much value. So it was really the C.O. of troops and myself who had to carry out all the treatment.”

		<div>-- END OF “THE DEATH SHIP” --
</div>
		<div>Private Charles Davidson delivered a vivid recollection of the outbreak, as published in historian Geoffrey Rice's book, “Black November: The 1918 Influenza Pandemic in New Zealand."

Pvt. Davidson on the deaths aboard the ship:

“When word went around that deaths had occurred, the effect was noticeable. There was no way of escape, nothing to do, nowhere to go, no medicine and little attention. Soldiers just died where they lay on deck… Bodies were wrapped in canvas and weighted with fire bars, then after a short service at dusk each evening, were committed to the deep in a chute forward of the bridge."
</div>
		<div>Friday 30 August</div>
		<div>The 78 lives lost to the virus:
</div>
		<div>Pvt. Charles A. Davidson’s account</div>
		<div>Fine and warm and sea smooth. 

At 6.30am a man was reported overboard. The ship at once turned around and a boat was got ready lowered. After going back about half a mile he was seen all right, swimming about and after a time was picked up OK. He was one of the invalids and I believe was delirious and jumped in when his guard was away temporarily. It took about 3 hours to catch up to the convoy again. 

Am feeling fairly weak today and am mess orderly but can’t eat the rubbish we get. I make an attempt with the rest but that is about all. Most of the boys are still down and I think will be some weeks before they are well again, if ever. The whole of our strength seems to have gone absolutely & it will take good food and a spell on land before any pick up again.
</div>
		<div> BACK TO BEGINNING</div>
		<div>Entry #51
</div>
		<div>Warm and calm and sea smooth. A few are able to move about but still an awful lot down. I was able to give a hand today to move a few off our deck on to another deck while we scrubbed the place down and then shifted them back. 

We have about 50 down for meals but the muck we get to eat does not tempt any one to eat, They get it on their plates look at it, turn it over a few times, taste it and that is the finish of it. There are tons of meat etc wasted just for the want of cooking into a decent dish, but it is the same every time, no-one can cut it and then if you could, it has no taste to it. 

The ship has also run short of medicine now, this sickness must have been something they did not bargain for.
</div>
		<div>Saturday 31 August</div>
		<div>9 additional deaths occurred on land</div>
		<div>18 years later</div>
		<div>*Reported cases are approximate</div>
		<div>A slight breeze and sea a bit choppy. Much cooler and fresher which is greatly needed on this stinking tub. Two or three hundred more on sick parade today and the nurses and doctors have their hands full all right now. 

I believe two nurses, the skipper and some of the officers, four or five engineers and 11 firemen are down with this rotten malady now & I heard also there are about 700 down all told, quite a catastrophe all right but only to be expected when men are packed in such a small space and have to eat and sleep and live there and then going through the tropics and anchoring 4 days in a fever stricken port.
 
The cause of the sickness which may be an African fever of some sort may be due to the water we took in at Capetown. Three more ships in our fleet today.
</div>
		<div>IN DECEMBER 1918, a Court of Inquiry was held to review the circumstances around the illness on the Tahiti. It found several factors which may have contributed, including:

Crowded quarters and poor ventilation: The most severe rates of infection occurred in those sleeping bunks rather than hammocks.
Medical provisions: The medical staff were overwhelmed with work. Nurses were praised for their diligence, while the orderlies were criticized for being ill-trained:

“Too much praise cannot be allocated to Sister Maxfield and the nurses under her charge, as all worked most assiduously and effectively to cope with the epidemic. It is regretted that the same cannot be said about the medical orderlies, who were apparently ill-trained and did not show any marked capability or zeal.”</div>

		<div>Listen to Dr. D.C. Low speak about the medical staff aboard the Tahiti:
</div>
		<div>HMNZT Tahiti's hospital</div>
		<div>26 AUGUST 1918:
</div>
		<div>Entry #50
</div>
		<div>Weather very hot and sea like glass and a lot more on sick parade, dozens of them in fact. The sickness is going round the ship very rapidly and every available bit of floor space is being converted into a hospital. Am still about the same myself and temperature is 102.2. All temperatures are being taken and any above 104 go into the hospital. 

I have not felt the need of parading sick yet and don’t think I will if I can help it as it is not much catch sleeping on the hard deck and I can get about all right but it makes one as weak as a kitten and it is great to see big strong men just bowled over and hardly able to walk, it is quite pitiful. 

Band practices are just now knocked in the head as some of the members are not well enough and cannot muster enough.
</div>
		<div>Departed Freetown</div>
		<div>Wednesday 28 August</div>
		<div>REPORTED CASES*:</div>
		<div>Arrived at Plymouth</div>
		<div>According to New Zealand historian Ryan McClane, only 260 of the 1, 117 troops onboard the Tahiti were fit for deployment six weeks after the troopships arrival in Plymouth. None of them would see combat, as WW1 ended shortly after their recovery on November 11, 1918. Seven percent of all those who departed onboard the Tahiti died from the influenza outbreak. 

The second wave of the 1918 pandemic would go on to claim millions of lives. The CDC estimates in total that one-third of the world's population at the time was infected with the virus, with at least 50 million deaths world-wide.

Marcus Hansen survived his bout with the virus and married his fiancée Vera Halfyard upon his return on December 29, 1918. The Hansens would have three children. Marcus resumed his employment in the postal service in New Zealand, where he remained until his death in 1963.

		<div>The aftermath</div>
		<div>Fairly warm and showers of rain occasionally.

An epidemic of influenza seems to have broken out on board. Sixty odd on this morning’s sick parade and 24 admissions to the hospital. Have caught it myself of course but so far am able to get about & think I will hang out all right but feel very crook. 

Saw a few porpoises quite near the boat today. We are still travelling in the same formation but the distances from each boat varies. 

No band this morning, as a lot of the members are not well. This afternoon we pasted some music on to cards instead of practicing. This morning we had a lecture for half an hour on transport etc in England and was a most idiotic lecture too. Had no object in it that I could see.

		<div>Friday 6 September</div>
		<div>One day after departing Freetown, private Marcus Hansen notes in his diary that the hospital aboard HMNZT Tahiti was over capacity. Despite the officers’ precautions, the 1918 influenza virus had managed to creep its way onboard. And with the crowded quarters, limited amount of medical supplies and poor ventilation, disaster is about to unfold. 
The Tahiti forges on, leaving behind a trail of death in its wake.
</div>
		<div>Rain nearly all day and sea fairly rough. Fine in the afternoon & did a little washing. We hope to reach a port tomorrow. This will make 9 weeks all but one day, and we all won’t be sorry the voyage is over. 

Last night we sighted what turned out to be a balloon attached to a destroyer & later on we could discern two destroyers & then two or three more. Today we have 6 or 7 in charge of us and also the balloon. Life belts are worn all the time now. 

There were another two deaths last night. The band has now disbanded & all the goods have been handed in and will be sent back to New Zealand. We were all issued with a field [dressing] pocket today and has to be sewn on the inside of our tunics.
</div>
		<div>“There were a hundred deaths between September the first and the tenth, the date we arrived in Plymouth. And of course, the ordinary ship's routine had to be altered everyday for funerals. For instance, one day we had 20 funerals. We did these in batches of four.”

		<div>Listen to Dr. D.C. Low speak on the deaths and funerals aboard Tahiti.
</div>
		<div>Fine but very cold and windy, sea very rough & spray coming over at times. 

More burials again, total somewhere about 70 now. Bought a couple of postcards today of this ship taken in rough sea and they are rather good ones. 

Nearly the whole of the decks are clear of the sick but the halls and passage ways are about covered with them. The coughing of a lot of men still continues and seems to be a lasting complaint. It looks as though nearly the whole of this [reinforcement] will not be fit for much after this set back they have had. 

Am feeling fairly well myself except for a cough now and again. Am mess orderly still. No band practice yet.

		<div>Tuesday 3 September</div>
		<div>Fine but very cold & sea fair. Land was in sight this morning and all very excited in the thought of getting on land again for good. We were told this morning by the O.C that we were now bound for London. At dinner time instructions were received to turn about and make for Plymouth which we did and arrived there at 3pm. 

It was bitterly cold as the wind was right ahead and we were going at top speed all the way. We alone and the balloon and one destroyer left the other part of the convoy and the cruiser had left before us & was here when we arrived. The country here looks really beautiful green fields & ploughed land with forests here and there. The town here looks very big and a lot of ships of all descriptions for war & otherwise. The people were all cheering as we went past the pier and up the river.

One man died as we were coming in to port. Total now 78 – 73 troops & 5 crew.
</div>
		<div>A 2010 study of the outbreak on HMNZT Tahiti, titled “Mortality risk factors for pandemic influenza on New Zealand troop ship, 1918,” reports that while exact numbers of total cases cannot be determined, in the official Inquiry Report the military commander estimated a total of 800 cases on the peak day.

With information obtained from the Auckland War Memorial Museum’s Cenotaph database, researchers were then able to approximate daily rates for total cases and deaths. At right is a repurposed version of their chart.

While the infection rate is approximate, it should be noted that the total numbers of deaths from the 2010 study matched a handwritten list of the dead, which was kept by Regimental Sergeant Major Percival Gunn McIntosh. The list was generously provided by his great-niece, Lynne Blake. 
</div>
		<div>The situation aboard HMNZT Tahiti was so severe that upon arrival in Plymouth, specialized trains were used to transport the ill to hospitals, where nine more deaths would occur, including one of the nurses, Esther Maud Tubman.
